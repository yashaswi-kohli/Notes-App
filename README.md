# Notes-App
I have built a notes app or todo list using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

The notes app is designed to be simple and user-friendly, allowing users to quickly create and organize their tasks or notes. One of the key features of this app is that even if you refresh the page, all of your notes will stay intact and not disappear, making it easy to keep track of your tasks and notes over time.
